# Docker Networking - Big question (do experiments) can two containers on two different bridge networks talk to each other?

Welcome! This guide will briefly show you how to enable two docker containers to talk to the internet, as well as each other!

***If you haven't already check out the [Intro Guide](https://github.com/SrKoDes/scripts/blob/main/docker/docker_guide.md) as well as my working [Master Commands List](https://github.com/SrKoDes/scripts/blob/main/docker/docker_commands.md)!***

### Intro

Docker has at least three pre-installed networks: `Bridge`, `Host`, and `None`. Each has a different bridge that defines its network capabilities. In this case, their driver names are the same as their network names with the exception of `None`'s driver named `Null`. Below are descriptions of each driver.
- **Bridge**: A network created by Docker to allow containers to talk to the internet as well as other containers on the same network. The default driver for any created network, if no driver is specified.
- **Host**: The container is placed on the host computer's network, i.e. your home internet.
- **Null**: The container has no networking capabilities.

### Diving In

Let's begin by turning on Docker if you haven't already. Let's take a look at our networks. Run:
```
docker network ls
```
We should see the networks we just learned about. By default, any networks we create will have the `Bridge` driver. Let's try creating a separate network called `net01`.
```
docker network create net01
docker network ls
```
Our output should look like the image below:

`docker run -ti ncat:v1.0 bash` - start up and enter container with ncat:v1.0 image (name is nifty_villani
`docker run -ti --name server01 --net net01 ncat:v1.0 bash` - start up and enter container named server01 in net01 with same image
`docker run -ti --name server02 --net net01 ncat:v1.0 bash`- start up and enter container named server02 in net01 with same image
`exit`- exit container

outside of the docker
`docker network connect bridge server02`- network bridge the server02 to bridge network, allowing it to ping 1st container created above
`docker exec -ti server02 bash`- re enter server02 container (and ping containers to see youre connection)

outside of the container![Uploading Screen Shot 2021-10-09 at 9.18.41 AM.pngâ€¦]()

`docker run -ti -p 45678:8080 ncat:v1.0 bash`


inside new container with ports
`nc -lp 8080`- adds a port listener on 8080 (nc allows you to connect and open a port on the system you run nc on. ncat listen on port 8080)

outside
`nc localhost 45678` - CONENCT to localhost port now you can send messages between each other


`docker run -ti -p 45672:8000 ncat:v1.0 bash` - create new container with different port

inside first new container
`nc -lp 8080` - open up the port again

inside newest container
`nc {ip of the above container} 8080` - connect to that port


docker hub

`docker tag ncat:v2.0 srkodes/ncat:v3.0` - create new image


`docker inspect {container ID}` to view Network info

`check /etc/resolv.conf` has teh local dns ---- maybe
